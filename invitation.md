[Please sign up: RSVP by Monday, January

 We’d like to plan for event resourcing, including building access. All
contact information and names will not be used for any marketing
purposes and only needed should we need to contact you about any last
minute event changes.

### Overview

If you have built a site in Drupal, you can contribute. We will split
into pairs or small groups and work on Drupal core issues. Bring your
laptop. For new folks: you can get a head start also by making an
account on Drupal.org and taking a look at the Drupal Ladder
[http://drupalladder.org/](http://drupalladder.org/ "http://drupalladder.org/")
If possible, install git before coming and git clone Drupal 8 core ([git
instructions](https://drupal.org/project/drupal/git-instructions)).

Can't join us physically in Boston? We will have limited Google Hangout
spots to sign into, first come, first serve. Review this [Boston Sprint
Weekend doc](http://bit.ly/bosdrupalsprint) with hangout connection
details.

After sprinting, we’ll wind down at a nearby watering hole for casual
drinks and conversation. Should folks need lodging after or can offer,
comment below; sprinters should self-match with opportunities.

### Time & Location

Sprint time: 10am until 5pm, Saturday, January 25\
 Location: Genuine Interactive, 500 Harrison St. 5R, Boston, MA

Parking is available for \$5 per car - just let the parking attendant
know you’re here for the Drupal Sprint at Genuine Interactive. This
building is also conveniently a 6-10 minute walk from the Broadway Red
line T stop or you can hop on the number 9 or 11 bus from Broadway T and
get off in one stop at the Harrison Ave. stop.

### Who it's for

Anyone with Drupal site building experience can contribute to Drupal
core. We'll have tasks suitable for programmers and non-programmers
alike.

### Why come

If you're like some Drupal developers or site builders, you've been
telling yourself for months that you should start contributing to Drupal
core. This sprint is your chance to get started with in-person training
and mentoring from friendly, experienced core contributors. It's also a
great way to start becoming familiar with Drupal 8.

If you've already started to work on core, come meet other contributors,
hang out in person, and work on manageable tasks in the Drupal core
queue. The goal is to help you help with core.

### What to expect

We'll kick things off with a brief introduction and agenda for the day.
We'll help match people with issues that are right for their skill
levels and areas of interest. Mentoring is also provided to help new
contributors set up a development environment and learn about the
contribution process.

### What to bring

-   An interest in Drupal contribution
-   A laptop with wireless connectivity and a long power cord
    (multi-plug extension cords encouraged)

### What to prepare

If you plan to contribute documentation or try patches only, all you
need a browser thanks to the simplytest.me service which allows you to
install Drupal and apply patches online. If you plan to contribute code,
we encourage you to prepare your laptop for Drupal 8 development in
advance so you can save time on the day of the sprint. Follow the steps
below if you have time before the sprint. We can help in the morning if
you get stuck on any of these steps.

1.  Create an account
    on[ ](http://drupal.org/)[drupal.org](http://drupal.org/) if you
    don't have one yet.
2.  Download[ ](https://dreditor.org/)[Dreditor](https://dreditor.org/),
    a browser plugin for Firefox and Chrome.
3.  Install an IRC client like ChatZilla, a browser plugin, or Pidgin
    for Linux and Windows, or Adium for Macs. We will hang out on
    \#drupal-contribute (read more on[ ](https://drupal.org/irc)[IRC and
    Drupal](https://drupal.org/irc)).
4.  Try out a shell. Macs have terminal in Applications/Utilities. For
    Windows, cygwin is common.
5.  A local web server. Some options:

-   [Installing the Acquia Dev
    Desktop](http://drupalize.me/videos/install-drupal-locally-dev-desktop) (Mac
    or Windows)

-   [Installing a web server on
    Ubuntu](http://drupalize.me/videos/installing-web-server-ubuntu) (Linux)

6.  A code-friendly text editor. ([Sublime Text
    2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is a free, cross-platform text
    editor.)
7.  Git
    ([install](http://drupal.org/documentation/git/install) and[ configure](http://drupal.org/documentation/git/configure);[ video](http://drupalize.me/videos/install-git)).
8.  Install the latest version
    of[ ](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush)[Drush
    7](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush). One liner installer:
9.  bash \<(curl
    -s[ ](https://gist.github.com/scor/7843568/raw/install-drush7.sh)[https://gist.github.com/scor/7843568/raw/install-drush7.sh](https://gist.github.com/scor/7843568/raw/install-drush7.sh))

### Sprint mentors

Whether you’re from New England or happen to be passing through, we're
looking for additional mentors if you are familiar with setting up a
development environment or with the core contribution process. People
who can help pre-select issues are encouraged to reach out to the
organizers in advance (always great to have a list of novice issues
lined up the day before).
